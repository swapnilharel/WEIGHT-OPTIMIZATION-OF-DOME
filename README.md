# WEIGHT-OPTIMIZATION-OF-DOME
• The main objective of the project was to optimize weight of a Trussed Dome structure under various loading condition viz. dead load, wind load, snow load and thermal load. • The design region was a Steel Dome Structure, consisting 130 elements and 51 nodes. The Computer Aided Drawing (CAD)  model was designed using SolidWorks.   • The Elemental Stresses and Nodal Displacements were calculated by running analysis in ANSYS and. • Using the analyzed  data from ANSYS, the optimization was carried out in MATLAB using optimization function named FMINCON. • The proposed optimization approach succeed in obtaining optimal designs with higher converged degree.   Software and tools used: MATLAB, ANSYS WORKBENCH, ANSYS APDL, SolidWorks, Microsoft Excel.
